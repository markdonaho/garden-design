## Objective
Complete Session 4 (Home UI & Garden Layout) and Session 5 (Bed Detail Modal), ensuring responsive UI, modal details, and clean lints.

## Key Changes
- Added `garden_planner/lib/screens/garden_layout_view.dart` with responsive GridView of beds (1/2/3 columns) and bed cards showing name, crop count, and soil last amended date.
- Added `garden_planner/lib/screens/home_screen.dart` implementing bottom navigation (Garden Beds, Tasks) and using `GardenLayoutView`.
- Updated `garden_planner/lib/main.dart` to set `home: HomeScreen()` and removed old `MyHomePage` scaffold.
- Added `garden_planner/lib/widgets/bed_detail_sheet.dart` and wired it into `GardenLayoutView` to show a modal bottom sheet with detailed soil and crops info plus quick actions.
- Updated `current_session_transcript.md` with continuous logs of directives, analysis, commands, and edits.

## Challenges
- Ensuring naming alignment between models and UI (`lastAmended`, `plantingDate`) and keeping modal layout scrollable and responsive.

## Decisions
- Kept placeholder actions for Add Crop and Edit Bed.
- Modal uses `FractionallySizedBox(heightFactor: 0.8)` and `isScrollControlled: true` for a clean, scrollable experience.

## Verification
- Linter reported no errors for changed files.
- User confirmed the grid renders and interactions work in Chrome; modal opens on bed tap.

## Ready for Next Session
- Session 6: Visual crop icons and garden polish (optional draggable sheet).
- Session 7: Tasks tab implementation (filters, toggle, delete).
- Session 8: Local persistence with `shared_preferences` (e.g., task completion state).
