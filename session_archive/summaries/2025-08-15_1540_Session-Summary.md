# Session Summary - 2025-08-15_1540

## Objective
The primary goal of this session was to implement a full-featured task management system within the Flutter application. This involved creating a dedicated screen to display, add, update, and delete garden-related tasks, replacing the existing placeholder UI. A secondary objective, introduced during the session, was to enhance the task creation feature to allow for more detailed input.

## Key Changes

### Task Management Feature (CRUD)
- **Created `TaskListView`:** A new screen (`lib/screens/task_list_view.dart`) was built to display a list of tasks from the `GardenProvider`.
- **Implemented Core Logic:** The `GardenProvider` was updated with methods to `addTask`, `deleteTask`, and `toggleTaskCompletion`.
- **Wired UI to Logic:** The `TaskListView` was connected to the provider, enabling users to check off tasks (toggling a strikethrough style), and delete tasks from the list.
- **Integrated into `HomeScreen`:** The placeholder widget in the main bottom navigation was replaced with the new `TaskListView`.

### Feature Enhancement (User-Requested)
- **Model Update:** The `GardenTask` model was updated to include an optional `notes` field.
- **Enhanced "Add Task" Dialog:** The dialog for adding new tasks was completely redesigned. It was changed to include:
  - A text field for optional notes.
  - A date picker, allowing users to select a specific due date rather than it defaulting to the current day.
- **UI Update:** The task list was updated to display the notes for each task, if present.

## Challenges
The session encountered a few challenges that required debugging:
- **Initial Command Error:** The first attempt to run the application failed due to executing the `flutter run` command from the wrong directory.
- **Compilation Errors:** A significant challenge arose from a mismatch between the `GardenTask` data model and its implementation in the provider and UI. Property names were incorrectly referenced using `snake_case` instead of the correct `camelCase` (e.g., `is_completed` vs. `isCompleted`).
- **Scope Issue:** A variable scope error occurred in `task_list_view.dart` when trying to access the `GardenProvider` from outside the `Consumer`'s build context. This was resolved by wrapping the `FloatingActionButton` in a `Builder` widget.

## Decisions
- **Transition to Stateful Widget:** To manage the local state of the enhanced "Add Task" dialog (which now included a selected date), the `TaskListView` was converted from a `StatelessWidget` to a `StatefulWidget`.
- **Future Strategy:** Based on the successful implementation of in-memory state management, the decision was made to proceed with implementing a persistent data solution. **Firebase** was chosen as the go-to platform, utilizing **Cloud Firestore** for the database and **Firebase Hosting** for deployment. A clear strategy for this migration was defined for the next session.
