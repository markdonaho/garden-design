# Session Summary: 2025-08-13_1035

## Objective
The primary goal of this session was to begin **Session 6: Visual Garden Representation**. The focus was on enhancing the user interface by adding visual cues for the crops planted in each garden bed, making the application more intuitive and thematic.

## Key Changes
- **Created `crop_icons.dart` Utility:** A new utility file was created to centralize the logic for mapping crop names to specific `IconData` from the Material library. This approach keeps the UI code clean and makes the icon set easily extensible.
- **Enhanced `BedDetailSheet`:** The crop list within the modal bottom sheet was updated to display an icon next to each crop name, replacing the generic lettered `CircleAvatar`.
- **Updated `GardenLayoutView`:** The main garden layout screen was modified to show a summary of crop icons directly on each bed card, providing an at-a-glance overview of the bed's contents.
- **Refined Bed Card Styling:** The `Card` widget for each bed was restyled with a brown border and a light brown background to visually represent a garden plot.
- **Updated `README.md`:** The project's main documentation was updated to reflect that Session 6 is "In Progress" and to log the completion of the crop icon feature.

## Challenges
- A minor issue occurred where an edit to `bed_detail_sheet.dart` was not immediately recognized by the tooling, causing a moment of confusion. This was resolved by re-reading the file and confirming the changes had been applied.

## Decisions
- **Icon Set:** The decision was made to use the built-in Material Design icons as a starting point for crop representation. This allows for rapid prototyping and will be expanded with custom SVG icons in a future session if needed.
- **Styling:** A thematic choice was made to style the bed cards to look more like garden beds, using brown tones to create a more immersive user experience.
