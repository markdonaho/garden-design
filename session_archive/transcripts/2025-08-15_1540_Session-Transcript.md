### [PLAN] 2025-08-15 15:40
User provided a detailed plan for Session 7: Task Management System.

**Session Goal:** Build a full-featured task management screen allowing users to view, create, update, and delete garden tasks.

**Execution Plan:**
1.  **Pre-flight Check:** Confirm functionality from Sessions 1-6 by running the app.
2.  **Create UI:** Build the `TaskListView` UI in `lib/screens/task_list_view.dart`.
3.  **Implement Logic:** Add `toggleTaskCompletion`, `deleteTask`, and `addTask` methods to `GardenProvider`.
4.  **Wire UI to Logic:** Connect UI elements in `TaskListView` to the new provider methods and implement the "Create Task" dialog.
5.  **Integrate:** Replace the "Tasks" tab placeholder in `HomeScreen` with the new `TaskListView`.

### [CMD] 2025-08-15 15:41
**Command:** `flutter run -d chrome`
**Directory:** `/Users/markdonaho/devStuff/garden-design`
**Output:**
```
Error: No pubspec.yaml file found.
This command should be run from the root of your Flutter project.
```
**Analysis:** Incorrect directory. The command was run from the project root instead of the Flutter application's root (`garden_planner`). Correcting this in the next step.

### [CMD] 2025-08-15 15:42
**Command:** `cd garden_planner && flutter run -d chrome`
**Directory:** `/Users/markdonaho/devStuff/garden-design`
**Output:**
```
Launching lib/main.dart on Chrome in debug mode...
Waiting for connection from debug service on Chrome...
...
Debug service listening on ws://127.0.0.1:52063/O_yeuQGeCfM=/ws
```
**Analysis:** The application launched successfully. The user provided screenshots confirming all pre-flight checks passed: Project Launch, Data Loading, Garden Layout, Bed Details, and Visual Enhancements are all working as expected. Pre-flight check complete.

### [CODE] 2025-08-15 15:45
**Action:** Implemented Session 7 Task Management System.
**Files Modified:**
- `garden_planner/lib/screens/task_list_view.dart` (Created)
- `garden_planner/lib/providers/garden_provider.dart` (Modified)
- `garden_planner/lib/screens/home_screen.dart` (Modified)
**Summary:** Completed all coding steps for Session 7. Created the task list UI, implemented the business logic in the provider, wired the UI to the logic, and integrated the new screen into the main app navigation. The application is now ready for final verification.

### [DEBUG] 2025-08-15 15:50
**Action:** Attempted to run the app for verification, but encountered compilation errors.
**Errors:**
- `Error: The getter 'is_completed' isn't defined for the class 'GardenTask'.`
- `Error: The getter 'due_date' isn't defined for the class 'GardenTask'.`
- `Error: No named parameter with the name 'due_date'.`
- `Error: The getter 'gardenProvider' isn't defined for the class 'TaskListView'.`
**Analysis:** A series of typos and a variable scope issue were identified. The property names in the `GardenTask` model were camelCase (`isCompleted`, `dueDate`) but were referenced in snake_case (`is_completed`, `due_date`) in the provider and UI. Additionally, `gardenProvider` was called in a scope where it was not accessible.
**Resolution:**
1.  Read `garden_models.dart` to confirm the correct property names.
2.  Corrected all property names in `garden_provider.dart` and `task_list_view.dart`.
3.  Wrapped the `FloatingActionButton` in a `Builder` widget in `task_list_view.dart` to provide the correct `BuildContext` for accessing the provider.

### [USER_DIRECTIVE] 2025-08-15 15:55
**Request:** User requested to modify the "Add Task" functionality.
**Requirements:**
1.  Add a field for optional notes to each task.
2.  Allow the user to select a due date instead of it defaulting to the current date.

### [CODE] 2025-08-15 15:58
**Action:** Implemented the user's requested changes for the task management system.
**Files Modified:**
- `garden_planner/lib/models/garden_models.dart`: Added `notes` field to `GardenTask` model.
- `garden_planner/lib/providers/garden_provider.dart`: Updated `addTask` to accept `dueDate` and `notes`.
- `garden_planner/lib/screens/task_list_view.dart`: Converted to `StatefulWidget`, updated the `ListTile` to display notes, and completely redesigned the "Add Task" dialog to include a notes field and a date picker.
**Summary:** The application's task creation feature is now significantly more robust, allowing for more detailed task entry. Ready for final verification.
