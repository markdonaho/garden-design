**Date:** 2025-08-12_1128  
**Session Type:** New Session Start  
**Objective:** Transform conceptual garden layout into comprehensive technical garden diagram using Mermaid.js

## Core Principles
- **Definition of "Done":** Never claim completion without observable evidence
- **GCP Resources:** Reference GCP_RESOURCES_REFERENCE.md for all GCP resource identifiers

## Session Log

### [USER_DIRECTIVE] 2025-08-12_1128
User provided comprehensive 4-phase plan to evolve garden layout from conceptual to technical:
- Phase 1: Establish Technical Foundation (coordinate system, scale, orientation, dimensions)
- Phase 2: Enrich with Data (plant specifics, soil composition, infrastructure)
- Phase 3: Implementation in Mermaid.js format
- Phase 4: Operational Schedule with Gantt charts

User requested creation of todo/project plan followed by execution.

### [ANALYSIS] 2025-08-12_1128
Current workspace appears to be empty garden-design directory. Need to establish project structure and create comprehensive technical garden plan using Mermaid.js markdown format.

### [CODE] 2025-08-12_1128
Created comprehensive project structure:
- README.md: Project overview and usage instructions
- PROJECT_PLAN.md: Detailed 4-phase execution plan with todos
- garden-plan.md: Main technical garden plan with Mermaid.js diagrams
- measurements.md: Detailed coordinate system and measurements
- soil-plans.md: Comprehensive soil composition strategies
- planting-schedule.md: Zone 7b specific planting calendar

### [PROGRESS] 2025-08-12_1128
Successfully completed all 4 phases of the garden design evolution:
✅ Phase 1: Technical Foundation - Coordinate system, scale, orientation, dimensions
✅ Phase 2: Data Enrichment - Plant specifics, soil composition, infrastructure  
✅ Phase 3: Mermaid.js Implementation - Layout diagrams and Gantt charts
✅ Phase 4: Operational Schedule - Complete planting calendar and maintenance

All documents created with comprehensive technical specifications for Zone 7b (Broken Arrow, OK) gardening.
