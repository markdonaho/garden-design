# Garden Design Technical Evolution - Project Plan

## Phase 1: Establish Technical Foundation (The "Where")

### 1.1 Coordinate System & Scale
- [ ] Define origin point (0,0) - recommend house corner or first garden bed corner
- [ ] Establish scale: 1 grid square = 1 square foot
- [ ] Create coordinate grid overlay for all components

### 1.2 Garden Orientation
- [ ] Add North arrow to diagram
- [ ] Document sun exposure patterns for each bed
- [ ] Note shadow cast by house/structure throughout day

### 1.3 Component Dimensions
- [ ] Measure exact dimensions of all 6 raised beds (L x W x H)
- [ ] Measure path widths (yellow areas)
- [ ] Document vertical planter dimensions and locations
- [ ] Map house/structure dimensions and placement

### 1.4 Key Structures
- [ ] Identify building icon (house vs shed)
- [ ] Map water sources (spigots, hose locations)
- [ ] Document large trees, compost bins, other fixed objects

## Phase 2: Enrich with Data (The "What")

### 2.1 Plant-Specific Details
- [ ] Document exact varieties for each crop
- [ ] Specify quantities per bed
- [ ] Define plant spacing requirements
- [ ] Note planting method (direct sow, transplant, tuber, etc.)

### 2.2 Soil Composition
- [ ] Define soil mix for each bed
- [ ] Plan amendments (bone meal, azomite, etc.)
- [ ] Map chicken manure compost usage
- [ ] Document soil testing schedule

### 2.3 Infrastructure
- [ ] Design irrigation layout (soaker hoses, drip lines)
- [ ] Plan trellising systems
- [ ] Document support structures needed

## Phase 3: Mermaid.js Implementation

### 3.1 Layout Diagram
- [ ] Create main garden layout using Mermaid graph
- [ ] Use subgraphs for bed groupings
- [ ] Include all plant data in node labels
- [ ] Add coordinate references

### 3.2 Data Integration
- [ ] Embed plant varieties, quantities, spacing
- [ ] Include soil amendment notes
- [ ] Add companion planting indicators

## Phase 4: Operational Schedule

### 4.1 Planting Calendar
- [ ] Research Zone 7b specific dates for Broken Arrow, OK
- [ ] Create planting timeline for all crops
- [ ] Plan succession planting opportunities

### 4.2 Gantt Chart
- [ ] Build Mermaid Gantt chart
- [ ] Include seed starting, planting, and harvest phases
- [ ] Add maintenance tasks (watering, fertilizing, pest control)

## Execution Priority

**High Priority (Complete First):**
1. Coordinate system and scale
2. Basic Mermaid layout diagram
3. Plant data collection

**Medium Priority:**
1. Detailed measurements
2. Soil composition plans
3. Gantt chart timeline

**Lower Priority:**
1. Infrastructure details
2. Advanced companion planting
3. Succession planning details

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Mermaid diagram renders correctly in Cursor
- [ ] All 6 beds are accurately mapped with coordinates
- [ ] Plant varieties and quantities are documented
- [ ] Gantt chart shows complete growing season
- [ ] Document is version-controlled and easily editable
