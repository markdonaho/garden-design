# Garden Design Technical Plan & Flutter App Development
A comprehensive, technical garden planning system designed for precision, data-rich management, and year-over-year consistency, plus a complete Flutter web app development roadmap.

## Project Overview

This project has evolved from a conceptual garden layout into two comprehensive systems:

1. **Technical Garden Documentation System** - Complete garden planning with Mermaid.js diagrams
2. **Flutter Garden Planner App** - Practical web application for garden management

The system provides:

- **Precise coordinate systems** with scaled measurements
- **Plant-specific data** including varieties, quantities, and spacing
- **Soil composition plans** with amendment tracking
- **Operational schedules** with Gantt chart timelines
- **Version-controlled documentation** for iterative improvement
- **Complete Flutter app architecture** ready for implementation
- **Visual enhancement research** for plant icons and garden graphics

## Key Features

### Garden Design System
- **Zone 7b (Broken Arrow, OK)** specific timing
- **Raised bed layouts** with precise dimensions
- **Vertical planter integration** for space optimization
- **Companion planting** strategies
- **Succession planting** schedules
- **Soil amendment tracking** including chicken manure integration

### Flutter App Development
- **9-session development plan** with clear deliverables
- **Provider state management** for efficient data handling
- **Responsive web design** for all devices
- **Local data persistence** with shared_preferences
- **Visual garden representation** with plant icons and pathways
- **Task management system** for garden chores

## Usage

### Garden Design Documentation
1. Open `garden-plan.md` in any Markdown editor with Mermaid support
2. Modify plant varieties, quantities, or timing as needed
3. Use the coordinate system for precise placement
4. Follow the Gantt chart for seasonal operations

### Flutter App Development
1. Follow the `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` for initial setup
2. Use `SESSION_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step development
3. Reference `VISUAL_ENHANCEMENT_RESEARCH.md` for graphics and icons
4. Follow the 9-session development plan in `FLUTTER_GARDEN_APP_PLAN.md`

## Technical Requirements

### Garden Documentation
- Markdown editor with Mermaid.js support (e.g., Cursor, VS Code with extensions)
- Git for version control
- Basic understanding of Zone 7b gardening

### Flutter App Development
- Flutter SDK installed and configured
- VS Code or Cursor with Flutter extensions
- Chrome browser for web development
- Basic understanding of Dart and Flutter concepts
